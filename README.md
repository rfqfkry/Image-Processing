# Image Processing Project

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Python scripts and practice files** for image processing tasks using OpenCV and related techniques. These files include camera calibration, image undistortion, depth/disparity processing, masking, and other basic computer vision exercises.

The goal is to organize practical examples and experiments that demonstrate common operations in image processing workflows.
